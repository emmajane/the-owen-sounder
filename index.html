<p>It may not be the usual venue, but we’re just going to do it this year. That’s right, the 36th Annual Authors’ Open House is really happening. On December 11, from 11:00 to 3:00, we’ll be invading Heartwood Hall, just up the street from The Ginger Press. Over a dozen famous local authors will be on hand to talk about their projects and sign copies of their books for everyone on your gift list. Who could ask for anything more? Well, I know, we all want to return home to the bookshop, but for this year, I think it’ll be great to get together at Heartwood, in a socially-distanced, double-vaxxed kind of way. If you can’t make it up those stairs, just give me a call at (519) 376-4233 and I’ll get your books autographed for you and have them ready for pickup at the store.</p>

<p>Our authors this year will include: Joan Beecroft, Dana Benson, Donna Jansen (A Place to Belong: Stories from Newcomers); John Butler (House of Refuge); John Fearnall (Leith); Lili Anne Holding (Mythos: Owen Sound’s Greek Community 1912-1932) Larry Jensen (These Streets I Know: Book + CD); Bonita Johnson de Matteis (Black Eyed Peas and Races: The Emancipation Picnic); Marie Knapp (Path to a More Inspiring Future); Barry More (A Thing of Beauty: The Story of Morland Place); Rob Rolfe (Sturgeon Bay: Poems); Richard-Yves Sitoski (No Sleep ’Til Eden: Poems); Richard Thomas (History of Owen Sound: 1840-1939 - in 3 volumes); Brad Wilcox (Too Far Back in the Bush: Meaford Knights Hockey Team); and Eric Zweig (Hockey Hall of Fame Heroes).</p>

<p>Heartwood Hall is located on the 2nd floor at 939 2nd Avenue East, in downtown Owen Sound. All COVID protocols will be in place for this special event. Although The Ginger Press will be closed on December 11 for the Authors’ Open House, we will be open at the bookshop throughout the rest of the festive season. Book your holidays with us!</p>

<h3>summer</h3>

<p>Phew! We made it! Preparing this issue of The Owen Sounder was fraught with the challenges of changing and confusing and sometimes counter-intuitive local, provincial, national and international COVID-19 protocols: Open? Closed? Open a little bit? Take-out? Eat outside? Pickup? Family bubbles? Work bubbles? Groups of five? Groups of ten? You know the dance!</p>

<p>We are delighted this issue to be introducing you to COVID cartoonist Rachel Oliver, who has been producing a cartoon every single day since March, 2020. Her acerbic wit highlights much of what we’re all experiencing. See page 19 to get your name on her distribution list.</p>

<p>We sincerely congratulate Summerfolk and Symphony in the Barn and SweetWater and Orchestra North and all the other organizers for tenaciously moving forward with their annual summer programs. We all need their music more than ever, and they’re working hard to make it happen someway, somehow. There’s not a lot of programming details here due to changing protocols, but we’ve provided contact information for you. Get in touch and give them all your support – financial and audience – to make sure they’re here for us in years to come.</p>

<p>AND, we’ve taken the huge plunge and brought back the award-winning downtown event ArtWalk! Eight galleries will have special exhibitions and demonstrations from 10 to 4 on Saturday June 26. We’ve added the Urban Sketchers Outdoor Art Competition – artists will be painting outdoors during the day (rain or shine) throughout the downtown. Programming details will be posted as they become available at the art walk urban sketchers page on Facebook.</p>



<h3>spring</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, we’ve transitioned into the Yellow Zone, making it a little easier to go about our daily lives. Who knows what the future holds? Here at The Ginger Press, we continue to reinvent ourselves on a regular (daily?) basis. The bookshop and cafe are open Thursday to Saturday from 10 til 2, and our website is open 24/7 for your online orders.</p>
<p>There was a nanosecond back in January when I really didn’t know what to do next. So, in conjunction with Miranda Miller of Grey Bruce Digital, we invented a retreat: The GP Publishing Accelerator (details on page 9).</p>
<p>“What is it?” you might ask. Well, an accelerator gives you access to the skills, mentorship and other supports you need. It’s intensive. And The GP Publishing Accelerator is in response to all those inquiries I have received over the years about publishing. After taking this course, you will know everything you need to know to publish your book. There will be a month of online sessions leading up to the retreat weekend (May 14-16), which will take place at the all-new Port Elgin Holiday Inn Express & Suites. There will also be a follow-up session upon completion. You will learn from two local experts who have spent decades gathering the information you need to move forward with your project. So, don’t be disappointed – yes, class size is limited to ensure the best experience for you – register today!</p>
<p>AND, it’s time to take a hike! We’ve included a portion of the Owen Sound trails map brochure in our centrefold this issue. If you’re ready to go a bit further afield, I recommend Ron Savage’s excellent book Secrets of Sydenham ($20) with 30 local hikes and explorations. Ron has also written a lovely little book on the Silent Valley Nature Reserve ($15) – “a stunning jewel in a beautiful necklace” – which is located just outside Owen Sound, and Sydenham End to End ($20) which has tales about this section of the Bruce Trail. Nicola Ross has just released Collingwood, the Blue Mountains and Beaver Valley Hikes ($29.95) which has 35 loop routes, “as well as oodles of apres-hiking suggestions.” And then, of course, there’s the old standby: The Bruce Trail Guide ($39.95) is now in its 30th edition; it details hikes from Niagara Falls to Tobermory. I’ll see you on the trails!</p>


<h2>2020</h2>

<h3>winter</h3>
    <a href="issues/TheOwenSounder_vol2-no02.pdf" class="button">Download vol. 2, no. 2 - winter 2020</a>
<p>This Owen Sounder has lots of things to do and places to go. Our stores, restaurants, services and events are adapting, altering, replacing, and reinventing constantly as we move forward with tenacity. Owen Sounders have grabbed opportunities buried in the depths of this pandemic and brought forth new ways of living and working and doing business we couldn’t have dreamed of a year ago. Yay, us!</p>
<p>Here at The Ginger Press, we have published more books this year than ever. The Café has temporarily transitioned into the Supper Club, and the Bookshop has reduced hours but more online ordering. What does the future hold? Who knows? But we will continue to move forward. And, okay, sometimes I make mistakes. In our last issue, I referred to the Musical Director of SweetWater as Richard Huizinga. Of course, his first name is Edwin. What was I thinking? Sorry about that, Edwin, and congrats to SweetWater for their excellent programming as part of SweetWater Surreal.</p>
<p>You know the drill: wash your hands; wear a mask; keep six feet apart; stay safe. But remember to reach out to friends and family, read books, write books, learn new skills, cook something different, and get outside. We will make lots of new holiday traditions this year; be sure to remind yourself of this remarkable place we live in and make this the best season you can for yourself and others.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and supporting The Owen Sounder. We’ll be back in the spring (deadline for ads and articles is February 18).</p>
<p>In the meantime, don’t be a stranger!</p>

<p>Welcome (back) to The Owen Sounder. In the early 1990s, The Ginger Press published a magazine which captured those times. When other projects intervened, we set The Owen Sounder aside, but not forever. Today, in the midst of the Covid crisis, it seems absolutely appropriate to bring The Owen Sounder back. It’s perfect for these times too. Delivered by Canada Post to every household and business in the City, The Owen Sounder is now expanded in grand and glorious colour.</p>
<p>As with all the other books and magazines published by The Ginger Press, the content of The Owen Sounder is 100% local. Articles and images by a wide range of Owen Sound experts explore what’s happening right here, right now, from labyrinths to music to the arts and gardens and more. And we can provide this to you at no charge because of the support of our advertisers, who are, not surprisingly, local too.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this new incarnation of The Owen Sounder. The plan is to make it a quarterly publication. If you would like to get involved, please get in touch. And don’t forget to tell our advertisers that “you saw it in The Owen Sounder.”</p>
